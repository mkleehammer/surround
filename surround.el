;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provides functions for working with pairs like parentheses and quotes,
;; including wrapping text, deleting pairs, marking pairs or within them, and
;; changing them.  This is similar to vim's surround plugin.
;;
;; For a detailed introduction and example usage, see the readme file at
;; https://github.com/mkleehammer/surround
;;
;; This package provides a keymap with functions for working with pairs of
;; delimiters like (), {}, quotes, etc.  If you are using use-package, the
;; easiest way to configure is like so:
;;
;;    (use-package surround
;;     :ensure t
;;     :bind-keymap ("M-'" . surround-keymap))
;;
;; This will bind M-', but obviously choose the key you prefer.  C-c s may be a
;; good option.  The keymap will have the following keys bound:
;;
;; - s :: Surrounds the region or current symbol with a pair
;; - i :: Selects the text within a pair (inner select / mark)
;; - o :: Selects the pair and text within (outer select / mark)
;; - k :: Kills text within a pair (inner kill)
;; - K :: Kills the pair and text within (outer kill)
;; - d :: Deletes the pair, but leaves text within
;; - c :: Change the pair for another (e.g. change [1] to {1})
;;
;; For convenience, the 'i' and 'k' commands perform an outer select or kill if
;; given a closing pair character, such as ')'.  That is, "M-' i (" will perform
;; an inner mark but "M-' i )" will perform an outer mark.  When the left and
;; right pair characters are the same, such as when using quotes, the commands
;; always perform the inner command.
;;
;; The keymap also has shortcut commands for marking some pairs, bound to just
;; the pair characters themselves.  For example, "M-' (" will mark within
;; parentheses.  These all work like the 'i' command, so they default to inner
;; but will work as an outer select if a right / closing pair character is
;; entered:
;;
;; Inner: ( { [ < ' ` "
;; Outer: ) } ] >

;;; Code:

(defvar surround-pairs
  ;; We only need pairs here where the left and right are different, though
  ;; shortcuts are created for each entry which is why quotes are here.  The
  ;; default behavior is to insert the same char at both ends.
  ;;
  ;; The keymap is created from this, so if you modify this after loading the
  ;; package, either recreate the keymap or restart Emacs.
